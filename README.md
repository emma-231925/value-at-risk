# Value at Risk Calculator

## Project Aim
The aim of this project was to create a Java application that calculated Value at Risk for both a protfolio and a single trade. The calculator needed to take in historical data and calculate the VaR for a given confidence level. 

## Solving a Problem
Calculating VaR by hand is time consuming so I wanted to automate the process and create and application that will carry out the calculations. I started with building a method that took a series of historical returns, a confidence level and the total investment amount and returned the Value at Risk. When this method was set up I worked on extended this to work for a portfolio of trades with different weights. The outcome of the project was a small, functional application that will take the given historical data and calculate the Value at Risk for you.

## What did I learn?
Throughout this project I have challenged my research and problem solving skills. Before starting the project I had limited knowledge of financial risk calculations and needed to undertake significant research in order to build my understanding and foundation for the calculator. 

Additionally, I was able to learn a lot about nested loops and how to initialise variables correctly to work within these loops. I came across many challenges with this and learnt how to effectively debug and correct my code.
